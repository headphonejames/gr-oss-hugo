We are the open source team at G-Research Systems. We have a large and wide range of impact in the Open Source ecosystem.

G-Research has created and evolves:

[Armada](https://github.com/G-Research/armada): a multi-Kubernetes cluster batch job scheduler. Fortified, we eat our own dog food.

[Other projects](https://github.com/topics/gr-oss)

G-Research contributes to and helps evolve:

[Open Stack](https://www.openstack.org/): a set of software components that provide common services for cloud infrastructure.

[G-Research github org](https://github.com/orgs/G-Research)
